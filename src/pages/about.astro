      I'm a frontend developper trying out the latest and greatest framework.
      From what i heard however, I'm not sure I can call this a framework. It
      seems to be a mega framework that takes all of the popular frameworks and
      blends them into one. That way anyone can try it out. Myself, I've worked
      with Vue for most of my career so far and I'm happy that i can try using
      Astro without needing to learn an entire new syntax.

      I'll check back in when I finish the starter tutorial to share my final
      thoughts!
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>
        I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
      </li>
      {
        identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
          <li>
            Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}
            {identity.hobbies[1]}
          </li>
        )
      }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {
      goal === 3 ? (
        <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>
      )
    }
  </body>
</html>
